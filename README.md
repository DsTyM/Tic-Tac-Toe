# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe is my own personal implementation of the popular Tic Tac Toe Game. It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and HTML 5 Canvas. Internet Connection has to be enabled for the project to run (because jQuery is included from Google CDN).

This project created just for learning.
